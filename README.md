🐍 Classic Snake Game
Welcome to the Classic Snake Game, a modern web-based recreation of the iconic game that once dominated Nokia mobile phones! This project is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, requiring no external libraries — making it lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy.

🎨 About the Project
The goal of this game is simple yet addictive: control the snake to eat the red food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into the walls or yourself. The game runs on a 30×30 grid, updating in real-time, and includes on-screen controls for mobile users.

This project is perfect for learning about:

Grid-based movement logic

Collision detection

Dynamic DOM manipulation

Saving data with localStorage (for high scores)

Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
