# Snake Game

A modern and professional implementation of the classic Snake game, built with HTML Canvas and pure JavaScript. This project is a complete refactor of a simple Snake game, with a focus on clean code, modern UI, and enhanced features.

## Features

*   **Modern UI/UX:** A clean and responsive design with a start screen, game over modal, and a professional color palette.
*   **HTML Canvas Rendering:** Smooth animations and improved performance by rendering the game on an HTML `<canvas>` element.
*   **Persistent High Score:** Your high score is saved in your browser's local storage, so you can compete against yourself.
*   **Mobile Touch Controls:** The game is fully playable on mobile devices with on-screen touch controls.
*   **Sound Effects:** Simple sound effects for eating food and game over.
*   **Pause and Resume:** Pause and resume the game at any time by pressing the 'P' key.

## How to Play

*   **Keyboard:** Use the arrow keys (or W, A, S, D) to change the snake's direction.
*   **Mobile:** Use the on-screen touch controls to change the snake's direction.
*   **Pause:** Press the 'P' key to pause and resume the game.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash

    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    - You can do this by double-clicking the `index.html` file, or by using a live server extension in your code editor.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure of the game.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the game and making it responsive.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the game logic and interactivity.

## Future Ideas

*   **Power-ups:** Add power-ups like speed boosts, score multipliers, or temporary invincibility.
*   **Different Game Modes:** Introduce different game modes, such as a "time attack" mode or a "survival" mode.
*   **Leaderboard:** Implement a global leaderboard to compete with other players.
*   **Customization:** Allow players to customize the snake's color or the game's theme.
